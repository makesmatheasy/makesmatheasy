<p style="color: #ababab !important;">A circular or elliptical paraboloid surface may be used as a parabolic reflector.
    Applications of this property are used in automobile headlights, solar furnaces, radar, and radio relay stations.
</p>
<br>
<br>
<h2 style="text-align:center;">Properties and applications of paraboloid</h2>
<br>

<h4 style="text-align:center;">Elliptic paraboloid</h4>
<p style="color: #ababab !important;">In a suitable Cartesian coordinate system, an elliptic paraboloid has the equation

    {\displaystyle z={\frac {x^{2}}{a^{2}}}+{\frac {y^{2}}{b^{2}}}.}{\displaystyle z={\frac {x^{2}}{a^{2}}}+{\frac
    {y^{2}}{b^{2}}}.}
    If a = b, an elliptic paraboloid is a circular paraboloid or paraboloid of revolution. It is a surface of revolution
    obtained by revolving a parabola around its axis.

    Obviously, a circular paraboloid contains circles. This is also true in the general case (see Circular section).

    From the point of view of projective geometry, an elliptic paraboloid is an ellipsoid that is tangent to the plane
    at infinity.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: center;">Plane sections</h4>
<p style="color: #ababab !important;">The plane sections of an elliptic paraboloid can be:

<p style="color: #ababab !important;"> a parabola, if the plane is parallel to the axis,</p>
<p style="color: #ababab !important;"> a point, if the plane is a tangent plane.</p>
<p style="color: #ababab !important;"> an ellipse or empty, otherwise. </p>
</p>

<br>

<h4 style="text-align:center;">Parabolic reflector</h4>
<p style="color: #ababab !important;">On the axis of a circular paraboloid, there is a point called the focus (or focal
    point), such that, if the paraboloid is a mirror, light (or other waves) from a point source at the focus is
    reflected into a parallel beam, parallel to the axis of the paraboloid. This also works the other way around: a
    parallel beam of light that is parallel to the axis of the paraboloid is concentrated at the focal point. For a
    proof, see Parabola § Proof of the reflective property.

    Therefore, the shape of a circular paraboloid is widely used in astronomy for parabolic reflectors and parabolic
    antennas.

    The surface of a rotating liquid is also a circular paraboloid. This is used in liquid-mirror telescopes and in
    making solid telescope mirrors (see rotating furnace).</p>

<h4 style="text-align:center">Hyperbolic paraboloid</h4>
<p style="color: #ababab !important;">The hyperbolic paraboloid is a doubly ruled surface: it contains two families of
    mutually skew lines. The lines in each family are parallel to a common plane, but not to each other. Hence the
    hyperbolic paraboloid is a conoid.

    These properties characterize hyperbolic paraboloids and are used in one of the oldest definitions of hyperbolic
    paraboloids: a hyperbolic paraboloid is a surface that may be generated by a moving line that is parallel to a fixed
    plane and crosses two fixed skew lines.

    This property makes it simple to manufacture a hyperbolic paraboloid from a variety of materials and for a variety
    of purposes, from concrete roofs to snack foods. In particular, Pringles fried snacks resemble a truncated
    hyperbolic paraboloid.[4]

    A hyperbolic paraboloid is a saddle surface, as its Gauss curvature is negative at every point. Therefore, although
    it is a ruled surface, it is not developable.

    From the point of view of projective geometry, a hyperbolic paraboloid is one-sheet hyperboloid that is tangent to
    the plane at infinity.

    A hyperbolic paraboloid of equation {\displaystyle z=axy}{\displaystyle z=axy} or {\displaystyle z={\tfrac
    {a}{2}}(x^{2}-y^{2})}{\displaystyle z={\tfrac {a}{2}}(x^{2}-y^{2})} (this is the same up to a rotation of axes) may
    be called a rectangular hyperbolic paraboloid, by analogy with rectangular hyperbolas.</p>

<h4 style="text-align:center;">Plane sections</h4>
<p style="color: #ababab !important;">A plane section of a hyperbolic paraboloid with equation

    {\displaystyle z={\frac {x^{2}}{a^{2}}}-{\frac {y^{2}}{b^{2}}}}{\displaystyle z={\frac {x^{2}}{a^{2}}}-{\frac
    {y^{2}}{b^{2}}}}
    can be

    a line, if the plane is parallel to the z-axis, and has an equation of the form {\displaystyle bx\pm
    ay+b=0}{\displaystyle bx\pm ay+b=0},
    a parabola, if the plane is parallel to the z-axis, and the section is not a line,
    a pair of intersecting lines, if the plane is a tangent plane,
    a hyperbola, otherwise.</p>

<br>

<h4 style="text-align:center;">Examples in architecture</h4>
<p style="color: #ababab !important;">Saddle roofs are often hyperbolic paraboloids as they are easily constructed from
    straight sections of material. Some examples:

    St. Mary's Cathedral, Tokyo, Japan (1964)
    Cathedral of Saint Mary of the Assumption, San Francisco, California, USA (1971)
    Saddledome in Calgary, Alberta, Canada (1983)
    L'Oceanogràfic in Valencia, Spain (2003)
    London Velopark, England (2011)</p>
