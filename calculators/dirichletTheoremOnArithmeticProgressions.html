    <h2 style="text-align:center;">Drichlet's Theorem</h2>
    <br><br>
    <p>In number theory, Dirichlet's theorem, also called the Dirichlet prime number theorem, states that
        for any two positive coprime integers a and d, there are infinitely many primes of the form a + nd,
        where n is also a positive integer. In other words, there are infinitely many primes that are
        congruent to a modulo d. The numbers of the form a + nd form an arithmetic progression</p>
    <p>\[a,\ a+d,\ a+2d,\ a+3d,\ \dots ,\ \]</p>
    <p>and Dirichlet's theorem states that this sequence contains infinitely many prime numbers. The
        theorem, named after Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet, extends Euclid's theorem that there are
        infinitely many prime numbers. Stronger forms of Dirichlet's theorem state that for any such
        arithmetic progression, the sum of the reciprocals of the prime numbers in the progression diverges
        and that different such arithmetic progressions with the same modulus have approximately the same
        proportions of primes. Equivalently, the primes are evenly distributed (asymptotically) among the
        congruence classes modulo d containing a's coprime to d.</p>
    <p>Since the primes thin out, on average, in accordance with the prime number theorem, the same must be
        true for the primes in arithmetic progressions. It is natural to ask about the way the primes are
        shared between the various arithmetic progressions for a given value of d (there are d of those,
        essentially, if we do not distinguish two progressions sharing almost all their terms). The answer
        is given in this form: the number of feasible progressions modulo d — those where a and d do not
        have a common factor > 1 — is given by Euler's totient function</p>
    <p>\[\varphi (d). \]</p>
    <p>Further, the proportion of primes in each of those is</p>
    <p>\[{\frac {1}{\varphi (d)}}.\ \]</p>
    <p>Dirichlet proved this theorem using Dirichlet L-series, but the proof is challenging enough that, in
        their classic text on number theory, the usually explicit Hardy and Wright (1979) report "this
        theorem is too difficult for insertion in this book."</p>
