## Documentation

[Makes Math Easy Documentation](https://github.com/sairish2001/Makes-Math-Easy-Documentation)

Documentation Website :- [Link](https://sairish2001.github.io/makesmatheasy-documentation//)

### Future Scope

- To add more useful calculators to solve Math problems along with steps
- To show steps of Integration, Differentiation, Laplace, Partial Differentiation rather than showing on eMathHelp website by redirecting to it
- Improving the UI
- Adding Image/Handwriting recognition so that user can click/write a problem and converted to text for further processing

Feel free to come up with new ideas yourself.
