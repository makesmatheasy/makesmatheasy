<h2 style="text-align:center;">Cayley-Hamilton Theorem</h2>
<br>

<p style="color:#ababab !important;">every square matrix over a commutative ring (such as the real or complex field)
    satisfies its own characteristic equation.</p>
<p style="color:#ababab !important;">A square matrix can be written as |A- λI|=0 and the corresponding eqn is</p>
<p> \[A^m+c_{m-1}A^{m-1}+...+c_0I\space=\space0\] </p>
<p style="color:#ababab !important;">The Cayley-Hamilton theorem states that an n×n matrix A is annihilated by its
    characteristic polynomial det(xI-A), which is monic of degree n.</p>

<h2 style="text-align:center">Diagonalization of Matrix</h2>
<br>
<p style="color:#ababab !important;">Matrix diagonalization is the process of taking a square matrix and converting it
    into a special type of matrix--a so-called diagonal matrix--that
    shares the same fundamental properties of the underlying matrix. Matrix diagonalization is equivalent to
    transforming the underlying system of
    equations into a special set of coordinate axes in which the matrix takes this canonical form. Diagonalizing a
    matrix is also equivalent to finding
    the matrix's eigenvalues, which turn out to be precisely the entries of the diagonalized matrix. Similarly, the
    eigenvectors make up the new set of
    axes corresponding to the diagonal matrix.
</p>
<br>
<p style="color:#ababab !important;">The remarkable relationship between a diagonalized matrix, eigenvalues, and
    eigenvectors follows from the beautiful mathematical identity
    (the eigen decomposition) that a square matrix A can be decomposed into the very special form
</p>
<p>\[A\space =\space PDP^{-1}\]</p>
<p style="color:#ababab !important;">D is the diagonalized matrix and can be written as diagnol matrix containing eigen
    values on the major diagnol</p>
