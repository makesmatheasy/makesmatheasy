<h4 style="text-align: center;">What are Sets?</h4>
<p style="color:#ababab !important;">A set is the representation of a collection of objects; distinct objects with
    one or more common properties.</p>

<h4 style="text-align: center;">Types of Sets</h4>
<ol>
    <li style="color:#ababab !important;list-style: none; text-align: center; font-size: 1.25rem;">Empty Set - A set
        with no
        elements. Empty sets are also called null sets or void sets and are
        denoted by { } or Î¦.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li style="color:#ababab !important;list-style: none; text-align: center; font-size: 1.25rem;">Singleton Set - A set
        with a
        single element. For example, {9}.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li style="color:#ababab !important;list-style: none; text-align: center; font-size: 1.25rem;">Power Set - A set
        qualifies as
        the subset of another set if all of its elements are also the elements
        of that another set. A collection of all the subsets of a given set is a
        power set.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li style="color:#ababab !important;list-style: none; text-align: center; font-size: 1.25rem;">Super Set - A
        super-set can be
        thought of as the parent set that at least contains all the elements of
        the subset and may or may not contain some extra elements.
    </li>
</ol>
<br>
<h4 style="text-align: center;">What are Relations and Functions? </h4>
<p style="color:#ababab !important;">Relations and functions are the set operations that help to trace the
    relationship between the elements of two or more distinct sets or between
    the elements of the same set.</p>
<br>
<p style="color:#ababab !important;">The relation is the subset of the Cartesian product which contains only some
    of the ordered pair based on the relationships defined between the first and
    second elements. The relation is usually denoted by R.</p>
<br>
<p style="color:#ababab !important;">If every element of a set A is related with one and only one element of
    another set then this kind of relation qualifies as a function. A function
    is a special case of relation where no two ordered pairs can have the same
    first element.</p>
<br>
<br>
<h4 style="text-align:center">Conditions to be a function - </h4>
<p style="color:#ababab !important;">A relation from a set X to a set Y is called a function if each element of X
    is related to exactly one element in Y. That is, given an element x in X,
    there is only one element in Y that x is related to.</p>

<h4 style="text-align:center">Types of Functions - </h4>
<ol>
    <li style="color:#ababab !important;list-style: none; text-align: center; font-size: 1.25rem;">One to one
        function(Injective):
        For each element in the domain there is one and only one element in the
        range.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li style="color:#ababab !important;list-style: none; text-align: center; font-size: 1.25rem;">Many to one function:
        When two or
        more elements from the domain are mapped to the same single elements in
        the range.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li style="color:#ababab !important;list-style: none; text-align: center; font-size: 1.25rem;">Onto
        function(Surjective): When
        every element of the range has been mapped to an element in the domain.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li style="color:#ababab !important;list-style: none; text-align: center; font-size: 1.25rem;">One-one and onto
        function(Bijective): A function which is both one to one and onto
        function.
    </li>
