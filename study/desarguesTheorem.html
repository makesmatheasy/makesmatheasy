    <h2 style="text-align:center;">Desargues' Theorem</h2>
    <br><br>
    <p>Denote the three vertices of one triangle by a, b and c, and those of the other by A, B and C. Axial
        perspectivity means that lines ab and AB meet in a point, lines ac and AC meet in a second point,
        and lines bc and BC meet in a third point, and that these three points all lie on a common line
        called the axis of perspectivity. Central perspectivity means that the three lines Aa, Bb and Cc are
        concurrent, at a point called the center of perspectivity.

    <p>This intersection theorem is true in the usual Euclidean plane but special care needs to be taken in
        exceptional cases, as when a pair of sides are parallel, so that their "point of intersection"
        recedes to infinity. Commonly, to remove these exceptions, mathematicians "complete" the Euclidean
        plane by adding points at infinity, following Jean-Victor Poncelet. This results in a projective
        plane.

    <p>Desargues's theorem is true for the real projective plane, for any projective space defined
        arithmetically from a field or division ring, for any projective space of dimension other than two,
        and for any
        projective space in which Pappus's theorem holds. However, there are many planes in which
        Desargues's theorem is false.

    <p>By definition, two triangles are perspective if and only if they are in perspective centrally (or,
        equivalently according to this theorem, in perspective axially). Note that perspective triangles
        need not be similar.</p>
