    <h1 style="text-align:center;">Co-Prime Numbers Theory</h1>
    <br>
    <p style="color:#ababab !important;">‘Co’ refers to a ‘pair’. So, we can define a pair of integers,
        let's say a and b, as coprime or primes to each other or
        mutually prime or relatively prime if:<br></p>p>
    <h5 style="text-align:center; color:#ababab !important;">* the only positive integer that divides both
        of them to give a remainder zero is 1<br></h5>
    <h5 style="text-align:center; color:#ababab !important;">* In other words, the HCF of the two numbers is
        1<br></h5>
    <h5 style="text-align:center; color:#ababab !important;">* Coprime numbers are denoted as gcd(a, b)=1 or
        (a, b)=1 or as “a is prime to b”</h5>
    <br>
    <h2 style="text-align:center;">How to find Coprime numbers?</h2>
    <br>
    <p style="color:#ababab !important;">Let's understand it with the help of an example:<br>

        Let's consider two numbers 6 and 15.
        Now find out the factors of 6 and 15. We get the factors of 6 as 1, 2, 3, 6 and factors of 15 as 1,
        3, 5, 15.On
        comparing the factors of these two numbers 6 and 15, we see that both these numbers have factors 1
        and 3 in common.
        The HCF for this pair is 3. Therefore the pair is not coprime.

        Properties of Coprime numbers
    </h2>
    <br>
    <h5 style="text-align:center; color:#ababab !important;">1) Numbers that are coprime may not necessarily
        be prime numbers themselves. For eg: (10,21), the numbers are not prime numbers if taken
        individually but they are coprime if considered as a pair. This concludes that composite numbers can
        be coprime numbers too.<br></h5>
    <h5 style="text-align:center; color:#ababab !important;">2) Prime numbers are coprime by default. For
        eg: (2,3), (5,11), (19,23) and so on. Every prime number has only two factors i.e. 1 and the number
        itself. Therefore, the only common factor of a pair of two prime numbers will be 1.<br></h5>
    <h5 style="text-align:center; color:#ababab !important;">3) Unity is considered coprime with everything
        else.<br></h5>
    <h5 style="text-align:center; color:#ababab !important;">4) The concept of coprime is meaningful only
        with natural numbers.<br></h5>
    <h5 style="text-align:center; color:#ababab !important;">5) Two successive integers are always coprime.
        For eg: (2,3), (11,12), (99,100) and so on; they have 1 as their HCF.<br></h5>
    <h5 style="text-align:center; color:#ababab !important;">6) The sum of any two coprime numbers is always
        coprime with the product of the same two coprime numbers. For eg: The sum of 2 and 3 is 5 and the
        product of 2 and 3 is 6. Hence, 5 and 6 are coprime numbers.<br></h5>
    <h5 style="text-align:center; color:#ababab !important;">7) If p and q are coprime numbers then p2 and
        q2 are also coprime numbers. For example, the squares of 5 and 6 i.e. 25 and 36 are also coprime to
        each other.<br></h5>
