<h4>Charpit's Method</h4>
<p>This method is used for solving non-linear partial differential
    equations of order one involving two independent variables.<br>
    A general method for solving the most general non-linear partial
    differential equation of order one i.e., the method for solving
</p>
<p>\[f(x,y,z,p,q)\space =\space 0\]</p>
<p>involving two independent variables x and y is given by Charpit and is
    known as Charpit’s method. This method is applied to solve only
    those partial differential equations which cannot be solved by already
    known methods. The basic idea in Charpit’s method is the introduction
    of another partial differential equation of order one of the form
</p>
<p>\[g(x,y,z,p,q)\space =\space\]</p>
<p>\[dz\space =\space pdx + qdy\]</p>
<p>This is a linear partial differential equation of order one with x, y,
    z, p and q as independent variables and g as the dependent variable.
    Thus, it can be solved by Lagrange’s method.
</p>
<p>Step 1. Transfer all the terms of given PDE to L.H.S. and denote the
    entire expression in L.H.S. by f(x, y, z, p, q).
</p>
<p>Step 2. Write down the Charpit’s auxiliary equations.</p>
<p>Step 3. Find the values of ∂ f/ ∂ x , ∂ f/∂ y etc. occurring in Charpit’s auxiliary equations. Put them in Charpit
    auxiliary equations and
    simplify.
</p>
<p>Step 4. Choose two proper fractions from Charpit’s auxiliary
    equations such that the resulting integral may come out as simplest
    relation involving at least one of p or q or both.

<h4>Clairaut's Method</h4>
<br>
<p>In mathematical analysis, Clairaut's equation (or the Clairaut equation) is a differential equation of the form</p>
<p>\[y(x)\space =\space x\frac{dy}{dx}\space +\space f(\frac{dy}{dx})\]</p>
<br>
<p>where f is continuously differentiable.</p>

<p>The singular solution envelopes are x=-f^'(c) and y=f(c)-cf^'(c).</p>
<p>A partial differential equation known as Clairaut's equation is given by</p>
<p>\[u\space =\space x u_x\space + y u_y\space +\space f(u_x+u_y) \]</p>
<p>Boundary value, condition accompanying a differential equation in the solution of physical problems. In mathematical
    problems arising from physical situations, there are two considerations involved when
    finding a solution: (1) the solution and its derivatives must satisfy a differential equation, which describes how
    the quantity behaves within the region; and (2) the solution and its derivatives must
    satisfy other auxiliary conditions either describing the influence from outside the region (boundary values) or
    giving information about the solution at a specified time (initial values), representing
    a compressed history of the system as it affects its future behaviour. A simple example of a boundary-value problem
    may be demonstrated by the assumption that a function satisfies the equation f′(x) = 2x
    for any x between 0 and 1 and that it is known that the function has the boundary value of 2 when x = 1. The
    function f(x) = x2 satisfies the differential equation but not the boundary condition. The
    function f(x) = x2 + 1, on the other hand, satisfies both the differential equation and the boundary condition. The
    solutions of differential equations involve unspecified constants, or functions in the
    case of several variables, which are determined by the auxiliary conditions.
