<h2>Power Series</h2>
<p>A power series about a, or just power series, is any series that can be written in the form,</p>
<p>\[\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} c_n (x-a)^{n}\]</p>
<p>where a<sub>n</sub>and c<sub>n</sub>n are numbers. The c<sub>n</sub> ’s are often called the
    coefficients of the series. The first thing to notice about a power series is that it is a function
    of x
    . That is different from any other kind of series that we’ve looked at to this point. In all the
    prior sections we’ve only allowed numbers in the series and now we are allowing variables to be in
    the
    series as well. This will not change how things work however. Everything that we know about series
    still holds.
</p>
<br>
<p>The interval of convergence must then contain the interval a−R&lt;x&lt;a+R since we know that the
    power series will converge for these values. We also know that the interval of convergence can’t
    contain
    x’s in the ranges x&lt;a−R and x&gt;a+R since we know the power series diverges for these value of x
    . Therefore, to completely identify the interval of convergence all that we have to do is determine
    if the power series will converge for x=a−R or x=a+R. If the power series converges for one or both
    of these values then we’ll need to include those in the interval of convergence.

<h4>Analytic Function</h4>
<p>A function f(x) containing the point x=x<sub>0</sub> is called analytic at x<sub>0</sub> if its
    Taylor's Series exists and converges to f(x) for all x </p>
<p>All polynomial functions are analytic everywhere</p>
<br>
<p>It is important to note that no matter what else is happening in the power series we are guaranteed
    to get convergence for x = a. The series may not converge for any other value of x, but it will
    always
    converge for x = a.
</p>
<h4>Ordinary Point</h4>
<p>At point x=x<sub>0</sub> is called an ordinary point </p>
<p>\[\frac{d^{2}y}{dx^{2}}+P(x)\frac{dy}{dx}+Q(x)y=0\]</p>
<p>If both functions are analytic at x = x<sub>0</sub></p>
<br>
<h4>Regular and Irregular Singular Points</h4>
<p>If a point is not ordinary then the point is singular</p>
<p>A singular point x = x<sub>0</sub> is called regular singular point if both (x-x<sub>0</sub>) and
    (x-x<sub>0</sub>)<sup>2</sup> are analytic at x = x<sub>0</sub></sup> else it is irregular </p>

<h4>Legendre's Differential Equation</h4>
<br>
<p>The differential equation of form,</p>
<p>\[(1-x^{2})\frac{d^{2}y}{dx^{2}}-2x\frac{dy}{dx}+n(n+1)y\space =\space 0\]</p>
<p>\[\frac{d}{dx}((1-x^{2})\frac{dy}{dx})+n(n+1)y\space =\space 0\]</p>
<p>is called Legendre's Differential Equation,where n is a real number </p>
<br>
<h4>Bessel's Differential Equation</h4>
<br>
<p>The differential equation of form,</p>
<p>\[x^{2}\frac{d^{2}y}{dx^{2}}+x\frac{dy}{dx}+(x^{2}-n^{2})y\space =\space 0\]</p>
<p>is called Bessel's Differential Equation of order n, where n is a positive constant </p>
<br>
<h4>Chebyshev's Differential Equation</h4>
<br>
<p>The differential equation of form,</p>
<p>\[(1-x^{2})\frac{d^{2}y}{dx^{2}}-x\frac{dy}{dx}+n^{2}y\space =\space 0\]</p>
<p>is called Chebyshev's Differential Equation</p>
<br>
<h4>Frobenius Method</h4>
<br>
<p>Steps-</p>
<p>1. Assume y = a<sub>0</sub>x<sup>m</sup>+a<sub>1</sub>x<sup>m+1</sup>+...</p>
<p>2. Substitute from 1 for y,<sup>dy</sup>&frasl;<sub>dx</sub> and
    <sup>d<sup>2</sup>x</sup>&frasl;<sub>dx<sup>2</sup></sup></sub>
</p>
<p>3. Equate to 0 the coefficient of lowest power of x. This gives a qudratic eqn in m</p>
<p>4. Equate to 0 other powers of x to find a<sub>1</sub>,a<sub>2</sub>,a<sub>3</sub>....</p>
<p>5. Substitute in eqn</p>
<br>
<p>Case 1 - If roots are distinct and dont differ by an integer</p>
<p>Let m<sub>1</sub>,m<sub>2</sub> be roots,then complete solution is</p>
<p>\[y\space =\space c_1(y)_{m_1} + c_2(y)_{m_2}\]</p>
<br>
<p>Case 2 - If roots are equal</p>
<p>\[y\space =\space c_1(y)_{m_1}+c_2(\frac{\delta y}{\delta x})_{m_1}\]</p>
<br>
<p>Case 3 - If roots are distinct , differ by integer and making a coefficient of y infinite</p>
<p>\[y\space =\space c_1(y)_{m_1} + c_2(\frac{\delta y}{\delta x})_{m_2}\]</p>
<br>
<p>Case 4 - If roots are distinct,differ by an integer and making one or more coefficients indeterminate
</p>
<p>Let the roots be m<sub>1</sub>,m<sub>2</sub>. If one of the coefficients becomes indeterminate when
    m=m<sub>2</sub>, the complete solution is given by putting m=m<sub>2</sub> in y</p>
